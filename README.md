# android-SDL2-HelloWorld-cmake

This is my port from the Android Hello World tutorial for SDL2 using cmake instead of Android.mk files.
The Original tutorial is not working, so I had to chango lots of things.
It is working now.
Hope that helps someone who wants to work with SDL2 and Android because right now (2018) the Android parts of SDL2 are not well documented.
DO NOT FORGET TO CHANDE the jni/SDL2 link to point to the correct SDL2 folder
